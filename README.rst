OpenMoko-utils
==============

OpenMoko-utils is a collection of applications that I developed with the
Neo Freerunner phone in mind, actually for the SHR stack.

There are three apps right now:

    * Checklist Manager
    * Alsa Mixer
    * GTK Theme Selector

The three of them are written in Python.
